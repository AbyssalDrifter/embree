.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
Scene objects are reference counted.
The \f[C]rtcReleaseScene\f[] function decrements the reference count of
the passed scene object.
When the reference count falls to 0 the scene gets destroyed.
.PP
The scene holds a reference to all attached geometries, thus if the
scene gets destroyed all geometries get detached and their reference
count decremented.
.SS EXIT STATUS
.PP
On failure an error code is set that can get queried using
\f[C]rtcDeviceGetError\f[].
